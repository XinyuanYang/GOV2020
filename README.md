This is the replication materials for our paper "Council Veto Power Constrains Democratic Mayoral Support for Multifamily Housing Policy".

The replication constains two datasets:data_mayors_2p_post1990_missing.rds and data_mayors_2p_post1990.rds. 

data_mayors_2p_post1990.rds is the full dataset without missing value (we imputed missing values for this dataset) and this is the only dataset used to replication the "Replication_Main.rmd".

For "Missing Data Analysis.Rmd", we used both data_mayors_2p_post1990_missing.rds and data_mayors_2p_post1990.rds for analysis and place load both datasets.
